BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Kolppa was a 58-year-old
woman with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and ejection
fraction of 15% who was initially admitted to the Faharb Medical Center Of following a cardiac arrest. On arrival in the
emergency department she was found to have recurrent ventricular

balloon pump to maintain her blood pressure.

chronic kidney disease , deep venous thrombosis , history of
cerebrovascular accident , history of hypercholesterolemia ,
history of coronary artery disease , history of diabetes , history
of GI bleed and history of chronic hepatitis C.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS: Ms. Rubins had a complicated
course in the hospital and her care was related primarily to
recurrent ventricular tachycardia and prolonged anoxic injury
affecting multiple organ systems. During her hospital course ,
she required pressor medications , an intraaortic balloon pump ,
and ventilator support. Of note , the patient had noted , prior to her
admission , that she would never want to be dependent upon "machines." Due to
poor neurological status and poor
prognosis , and in conjunction with the patient's previously expressed wishes ,
medical care was withdrawn on 6/14 after many discussions with family. The
patient's primary care physician , Dr Sangh , was involved with these
discussions. The intraaortic balloon pump was turned off. Pressure medications
were held and the mechanical ventilator was stopped. The patient passed away
on 0/14/07 shortly after removal of mechanical support.
