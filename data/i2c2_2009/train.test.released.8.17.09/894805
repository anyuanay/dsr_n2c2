Discharge Date: 7/4/2000
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: DYSPNEA.
OTHER DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE , DIABETES MELLITUS
AND STATUS POST CVA.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: 66 year-old male complaining of shortness of
breath times six months.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: At baseline the patient exerts
himself without significant chest
pain or pressure. Last February he recalls the onset of shortness
of breath gradually over several months time. Maximal exertion has
been limited by walking utilization at one-quarter mile with
significant symptoms fatigue. The development of severe shortness
of breath occurred most rapidly eight days prior to admission when
he experienced air starvation while getting into a car associated
with significant difficulty with speech and slurring times two
minutes. There was no muscle weakness , visual change , loss of
consciousness , palpitation , but the patient did feel as if he was
about to lose consciousness. Mr. Morath also denied labored
breathing , though his breathing was noted to be shallow and
improved immediately thereafter. There was cough associated with
post nasal drip but not hemoptysis. He admitted to left sided
chest pain lasting 30 seconds which was believed not to be cardiac
by his outpatient cardiologist , Dr. Joshua Lietzke On 0/7 he
was admitted to Com Sweeelkprai Medical Center Of for two days where echocardiogram
was performed as well as a chest x-ray and he was ruled out for
myocardial infarction. A VQ scan was then arranged for 8/27 at
which time he also had a Dobutamine Sestamibi scan. The test were
not available at the time of his admission the Ci Of Center on 1/22 At the time of his admission he denied any
shortness of breath though admitted to shortness of breath with
minimal exertion.
MEDICATION: NPH Insulin , Regular INsulin , Glucophage and Aspirin.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ( 1 ) Coronary artery disease. No history of
myocardial infarction. ( 2 ) Status post
coronary artery bypass graft March , 1995 after acceleration of
anginal chest pain. Catheterization at that time had revealed 60%
proximal left anterior descending lesion , totally occluded circ and
50% ramus with an right coronary artery mid-85% stenosis. Left
ventricular ejection fraction was 61% at that time. Coronary
artery bypass graft in 1995 was LIMA to LAD , SVG to PDA , SVG to
Ramus , SVG to OM. Sestamibi scan performed in August of hte year
2000 demonstrated 5 out of 20 segments of mild inferior ischemia
with increased right ventricular uptake. ( 3 ) Insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus diagnosed in 1980. ( 4 ) Cerebrovascular accident
1997 with residual right lower extremity motor debilitation and
word finding. ( 5 ) P32 , Calcium 45 , Carbon 14 exposure at work.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a microbiologist at Ford , works on virus in Vandmi Ave , Co , New York 88983 harbor and
lives in Delpa He has a tobacco history significant for 35
pack years of pipe and cigarette smoking. He has no significant
alcohol history.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 98.2 , Heart rate
66 , Blood pressure 144/84 , 96% O2 sat on
room air. NECK: JVP was at 8 cm , carotids 2+ bilaterally without
bruit and no lymphadenopathy. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm with
a loud P2 at the left upper sternal border and S4. LUNGS: Clear
to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes or crackles. ABDOMEN:
Obese , nontender , nondistended with normal abdominal bowel sounds
and a palpable liver margin. Right rib cage nontender.
EXTREMITIES: Demonstrated 1+ bilateral pitting edema with palpable
pulses bilaterally , they were cool.
LABORATORY EVALUATION: Normal electrolytes with serum creatinine
of 0.8. White blood count 9.7. Hematocrit
32.2. Platelets 225. Serial CK's were obtained and were 35 , 36 ,
and 31. Dedimer was 411. Troponin I was 0.01. Electrocardiogram
demonstrated atrial flutter with a 4 to 1 block at 65 beats per
minute without ST-T wave changes. He ambulated times four minus
with a D sat from 95% to 90 to 92 %.
HOSPITAL COURSE: This 66 year-old male with coronary disease ,
status post coronary artery bypass graft with an
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus complained of excellerating
shortness of breath times six months with minimal exertion. After
a presentation with low intermediate pre-test probability for
pulmonary embolus , we obtained a VQ scan that was determiend to be
intermediate probability. The patient was then referred for a
coronary angiography. This was performed on 4/23 and revealed
three vessel native coronary disease and one occluded bypass graft.
Left anterior descending artery had a discrete mid 50 % stenosis
occluded distally. The ramus had a smooth discrete 80% stenosis.
The left circumflex artery was totally occluded proximally. The
right coronary artery was also totally occluded but in the
midportion. Of the graft , the left internal mammary artery to the
left anterior descending was patent. Saphenous vein grafts to the
ramus was totally occluded at the Tessio site. SVG to the right
coronary artery was patent. Lower extremity noninvasive studies
were negative for deep venous thrombosis. The patient's dyspnea on
exertion was deemed to be due to left ventricular diastolic
dysfunction and the patient was discharged on appropriate
anti-hypertensive and ischemic medical regimen for follow up with
his cardiologist , Dr. Gregg Berlin on 10/19 in stable condition.
MEDICATION AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE: Aspirin 325 mg po q day ,
Atenolol 50 mg po q am , NPH
Humulin Insulin 20 units qam , 4 units qhs subcutaneously , Regular
Insulin on a sliding scale , lisinopril 10 mg po qam , Sublingual
Nitroglycerin as needed for chest pain q 5 minutes times 3 ,
Simvastatin 20 mg po qhs , Micforman 1 gram po bid , Plavix 75 mg po
