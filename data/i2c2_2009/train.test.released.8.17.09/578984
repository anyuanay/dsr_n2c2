Discharge Date: 11/8/2005
ATTENDING: EDMUNDO STEVIE BEDOKA MD
SERVICE:
The patient was admitted on the cardiac surgical service under
the care of Dr. Kyle Lennington
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Heldman is a 69-year-old male with end-stage renal disease on
hemodialysis. He is status post CABG x1 and aortic valve
replacement in February 2004. He presented to the emergency
department prior to admission with shortness of breath. Chest
x-ray was taken that revealed pulmonary edema. Stated he had
been complaining of shortness of breath over the month prior to
admission with no dyspnea on exertion or chest pain. While in
the emergency department , he had respiratory distress with O2
oxygen saturations 69%. An echocardiogram was done at that time.
It was significant for showing evidence of a dehiscence of the
bioprosthetic aortic valve with prolapse into the left
ventricular outflow tract. It was noted that there is at least
moderate perivalvular aortic regurgitation. It also noted mitral
valve had moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. As stated
previously , he was admitted to the cardiac surgical service for
repair/replacement of his aortic and mitral valves.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Includes hypertension , diabetes mellitus , renal failure ,
hyperlipidemia , gout , GERD , closed angle glaucoma , history of
colonic lymphoma.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
Right arm AV fistula that was originally placed in the year 2000
and revised in 2001 , 2002 , and 2003. A right brachiocephalic
stent was also placed.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
No history of tobacco use.
ALLERGIES:
No known drug allergies.
PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:
Labetalol , 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. , amlodipine 10 mg p.o. daily ,
lisinopril , 20 mg p.o. day , Zocor 40 mg p.o. daily , PhosLo 1334
mg p.o. a.c.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Vital signs , temperature 95.8 , heart rate 74 , blood pressure in
the right arm 134/62. HEENT , dentition without evidence of
infection , no carotid bruit. Cardiovascular , regular rate and
rhythm. Peripheral pulses are the following , peripheral pulses
are 2+the carotid , radial , and femoral. The dorsalis pedis and
posterior tibial are each present by Doppler bilaterally.
Respiratory rales present bilaterally. Neuro , cool extremities
with monophasic pulse.
PREOPERATIVE LABS:
Sodium 141 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 102. Carbon dioxide 29 , BUN
26 , creatinine 5.8 , glucose 195 , magnesium 1.9 , white blood cells
6.11 , hematocrit 28 , hemoglobin 9.5 , and platelets 98 , 000. PT
14.8 , INR 1.1 , PTT 42.2. Arterial blood gas showed pO2 of 64 , pH
7.38 , PCO2 of 52 and the base excess of 4. Cardiac
catheterization data on 1/3/04 , coronary anatomy , 10% proximal
LAD , 5% proximal circumflex , 85% mid RCA with a codominant
circulation. ECG on 10/0/05 shows first-degree AV block with
left anterior hemiblock with inverted Ts. Chest x-ray on
10/24/05 consistent with congestive heart failure.
Brachiocephalic and right subclavian stents were in place.
HOSPITAL COURSE
BRIEF OPERATIVE NOTE:
Date of surgery , 2/13/05.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
See magna valve three months prior. EPL on echo showed grossly
mobile on the stable aortic valve prosthesis moderate , MR. No
vegetations.
PROCEDURE:
Reoperation of ascending aortic dissection , aortic valve
replacement , #24 homograph , MVP with Alfieri suture.
BYPASS TIME:
355 minutes ,
CROSSCLAMP TIME:
265 minutes.
One ventricular wire , one pericardial tube , one retrosternal
tube , two left pleural tubes and two right pleural tubes were
placed.
FINDINGS:
Dense inflammatory edematous scar tissue throughout pericardium ,
especially periaortic. Right axillary cannulation with 6 mm
Hemashield side. Percutaneous right CF decannulation.
Uneventful re-sternotomy.
Previous SVG PDA injured during dissection , repaired with
interrupted 7-0 Prolene. Aortic valve prosthesis dehisced 3/4 of
circumference with question of an abscess cavity near LCC/RCC
junction. Debridement , the annulus is of extensive inflammatory
tissue. Previous Dacron aortic root patch removed due to pocket
of pus on the anterior aspect. No. 24 allograft placed with
double layer proximal suture line. SVG and both coronary
arteries implanted as buttons. Distal suture line continuous 4-0
Prolene. Transaortic and mitral valves replaced.
After the operation , the patient was transferred to the cardiac
intensive care unit in stable condition. His postoperative
course was complicated by the following:
1. Infectious disease: Although , Mr. Ownbey had multiple blood
cultures , sent , they all proved to be negative as of the date of
discharge. Although Mr. Cavitt was never felt to be bacteremic ,
the cultures that were sent from the operating room were of the
aortic valve prosthesis. This never showed the organisms
identified on Gram stain and MSSA stain. However , the infectious
disease physicians were consulted and felt that Mr. Sanjurjo should
be on vancomycin , rifampin , and gentamicin. As at the time of
discharge , Mr. Bersamin has finished his regimen of gentamicin and
will continue to be on both vancomycin and rifampin until
1/3/04. The rifampin he will take orally and the vancomycin he
will get after dialysis three times a week. While an inpatient ,
Mr. Rakus never had any evidence of leukocytosis or bacteremia.
2. Cardiovascular: Ms. Johe was noted to have a first-degree
AV block on postoperative day #7 with a PR interval of 0.35. Up
into this point he had been receiving labetalol. This was held
and the electrophysiology consult was obtained. The
electrophysiology service saw the patient agreed to be an
excellent candidate for permanent pacemaker. Initially they
attempted to gain access to the right brachiocephalic/subclavian.
However , this proved to be difficult and ultimately obtain
access through the left iliac. His permanent pacemaker was
placed on 1/29/05 and was interrogated the following day and
felt to be functioning appropriately. He was restarted on his
labetalol and as of the time of discharge , has had no symptoms.
Other than the above , Ms. Dingman was weaned from his oxygen
requirement , mobilized rapidly following surgery. All epicardial
pacing wires and chest tubes were removed without complication.
He will be discharged home on the following medications aspirin
325 mg p.o. daily , hydralazine 100 mg p.o. q.i.d. , labetalol100
mg p.o. t.i.d. , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. , oxycodone 5 mg p.o.
6 hours p.r.n. pain , rifampin 300 mg p.o. q.8h. , vancomycin for
which he will receive following dialysis until 5/14/05 , Zocor 40
mg p.o. q.h.s. , losartan 100 mg p.o. daily. Mr. Llanez will
follow up with Dr. Owston , cardiac surgeon , in six weeks , and Dr.
Geister , cardiologist , in three to four weeks , Dr. Kmiecik , the
patient's primary care physician , in one to two weeks and Dr.
Vaught , cardiologist , in two weeks.
