leukocytes ( - ). C. diff , stool cultures pending. Had completely normal
abdominal CT 1 month ago for identical symptomatology , only able to
obtain abd CT without contrast due to IV dye allergy. Symptoms resolved
spontaneously by time of discharge--will discharge on reglan and imodium
for symptomatic relief , with GI outpatient follow-up at Sampdesys Medical Center
on 11/24/05 with Dr. Armand Leventhal for further evaluation of chronic
diarrhea and mild RLQ tenderness. ?poor sugar control contributing to

years ago in a house fire--unable to watch news on TV subsequently. No
evidence of secondary gain--felt that moving to assisted living facility

time. Also evaluated by Spanish-speaking social worker , who knows Ms.
Oka well , extremely helpful in outlining home situation , issues.
