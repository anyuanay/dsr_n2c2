Discharge Date: 10/20/1991
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: STATUS POST CARDIAC TRANSPLANT.
OTHER DIAGNOSIS: ORAL HERPES.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 60 year old man with
a longstanding history of non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy with congestive heart failure who was originally
admitted on 9 of August with worsening fatigue and dyspnea on exertion
for augmentation of cardiac function. He was well until l96l when
he initially presented with left bundle-branch block , left
ventricular hypertrophy , and transient chest pain. He then had
high grade ventricular ectopic activity in l972 treated with
Quinaglute. Subsequently from l972 to l988 , examination was
notable for worsening left ventricular function. In l988 , he had
recurrent frequent congestive heart failure and underwent cardiac
catheterization which showed an enlarged hypokinetic ventricle with
an ejection fraction of around 32%. His coronary arteries showed
acute marginal of 70% stenosis and 40% of the mid circumflex. In
10/27 , his ejection fraction by right ventriculogram was 20%. In
1/28 , he had atypical pneumonia followed by recurrent congestive
heart failure. Subsequent course was notable for dyspnea on
exertion , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and orthopnea. He was
treated with Lasix , Zaroxolyn , Captopril , and Quinaglute. In
January , he was admitted to the Worthrest Hospital for
worsening symptoms , weight gain , and creatinine of 2.9. He was
managed with decreased Lasix , increased Captopril , and ultimately
decided to treate with Lasix and Zaroxolyn. He was then placed on
the Cardiac Transplant List and underwent transplant evaluation.
Exercise tolerance test showed 8 minutes and 43 seconds bicycle
with O2 uptake of l2. Right heart catheterization showed wedge
pressure of 25. PPD was negative and abdominal ultrasound was
negative. Echo showed global left ventricular dysfunction , apical
thrombus , mild tricuspid regurgitation , and mild mitral
regurgitation. Cholesterol was l53 , l-2 immunoglobulins within
normal limits , and toxo was plus IgG and minus IgM. He had
negative hepatitis , histo , blasto , or coccidiomycosis. CMV showed
borderline IgG and negative IgM and EBV showed positive IgG and
negative IgM. Since his discharge in November , he has noted
worsening of symptoms with decreased exercise tolerance and
increased orthopnea.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted and ended up being
started on Dobutamine and had gradually declining
course during his admission culminating in having a cardiac
transplant when a heart became available. This occurred on
3/9/9l. His post-operative course was uncomplicated and his
subsequent course was complicated only by acute worsening of his
renal function associated with high Cyclosporin levels with the
Cyclosporin held and the level allowed to come down. His renal
function returned to baseline. He also developed an oral herpes
lesion. He subsequently did very well post-operatively. Multiple
right ventricular biopsies were negative for rejection. On biopsy
on 0/2 , his wedge pressure was l8 , right atrial pressure l3 ,
right ventricular 48/l4 , and PA pressure of 48/24. He tolerated
slow taper of his steroids without event and it was noted that he
had some tremor also post-operatively which was attributed to
Cyclosporin toxicity. Other than that , his post-operative course
was uncomplicated.
DISPOSITION: The patient is discharged to home on 8/1/9l. He is
to have follow-up with Dr. Blay as well as Dr. Hori
