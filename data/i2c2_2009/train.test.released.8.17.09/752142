Hospital course:
Generalized pain: She has a history of both rheumatoid arthritis
and fibromyalgia and some symptoms that have been concerning for
Polymyalgia rheumatica. For her acute pain exacerbation , a pain consult
was obtained and recommended using vicodin rather than dilaudid and
neurontin rather that topamax. These changes were made with good effect. A
rheumatology consult was also obtained and
suggested starting prednisone 10mg qd for possible PMR with close
follow up with her rheumatologist Dr. Dambrosi . They also suggested starting
calcium + vitaminD. Her pain improved on the
prednisone and she was seen by physical therapy who suggested
rehab placement for deconditioning and inability to care for herself.
**Renal: During the hospitalization , she developed new acute renal
failure due to decreased PO intake of fluids and continuation of her home
dose of lasix of 160qd which she then stated she had not been taking.
This was due to a pre-renal state and resolved completely with IV fluids.
**Depression: She was continued on her home regimen of elavil , seroquel ,
zoloft , and buspar.
**Diabetes Mellitus: She was continued on her home insulin regimen with
excellent control.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: PLease return if you develop fevers , chills , worsening shortness of
breath.
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
