SPEAKER NAME: Roscoe Campean , M.D.
ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:
Congestive heart failure.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
Congestive heart failure , mitral regurgitation , and atrial
fibrillation.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Chest pain x 3 months and shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a 75-year-old female with no previous cardiac disease who
presented this morning with chest pain and shortness of breath ,
which had been limiting her over the last month. She had
gastrointestinal surgery earlier this year , complicated by need
for wound infection with revision and debridement.
Before her surgery , she could walk 20 minutes every morning , and
was very active. Over the last month , she has been limited by
shortness of breath , substernal chest pressure , and an overall
decrease in exercise tolerance. She cannot walk across the room
without difficulty now. The pressure in her chest is
nonradiating , is like a pressure rather than sharp , comes
unpredictably with exertion , and is relieved by rest. The
shortness of breath accompanies the pain. The symptoms have been
becoming more severe , and last night , she had rest shortness of
breath and chest pain. This morning she came to the emergency
department because her visiting nurse for her wound care told her
she looked worse and more short of breath and that she should
come to the hospital. She has never had chest pain or shortness
of breath until a little over a month ago , but does take
beta-blockers for a few isolated episodes of nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia that she had during her surgery
admission. She sleeps on two pillows every night , which is
chronic but does not get short of breath when flat. She denies
PND , palpitations , weight gain , swelling , or syncopal episodes.
She is a nonsmoker , nondiabetic without high cholesterol that she
knows of. Her chest pain is 2/10 upon admission to the emergency
department and is now 0/10 with nitroglycerin. In the emergency
room , she was given heparin , Plavix , aspirin , beta-blocker ,
Plavix 300 , and oxygen.
REVIEW OF SYSTEM:
She does not have any gastrointestinal symptoms. Her pain is
unrelated to eating. She has no cough , sputum production , and no
history of blood clots. She does not have calf pain , and she has
no neurologic symptoms.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Status post bowel resection for diverticulitis , status post
ileostomy take down in 11/6 , status post closure of wound
2/20/04 , and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia during last
hospitalization.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Brother with angina at age less than 55.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
No tobacco. No ETOH.
MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Beta-blocker ( the patient does not know dose ).
ALLERGIES:
Bactrim.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Vital signs: Afebrile , heart rate 83 , blood pressure 113/72 ,
respirations of 18 , and saturation 98% on room air. In general ,
the patient was sitting up comfortable , in no acute distress ,
breathing comfortably. Coronary exam: Regular rate and rhythm.
Normal S1 and S2. Slight murmur diastolic in the axilla. Heart
sounds were distant. Jugular venous pressure at 8 cm.
Pulmonary: Faint crackles inferiorly bilaterally superior 2/3rd
clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdominal exam: Positive
bowel sounds. Wound was covered , some small amount of drainage
on the dressing , nontender , and nondistended. Extremities: 2+
pulses bilaterally , 1+ pretibial edema bilaterally. Neck exam
was significant for loud carotid bruits bilaterally.
ADMIT LABS:
White blood cell count 9.5 , hemoglobin 12.3 , hematocrit 38 ,
platelets 213 , 000 , calcium 8.2 , magnesium 1.6 , sodium 134 ,
potassium 4.3 , chloride 104 , bicarbonate 22 , BUN 19 , creatinine
0.8 , and blood glucose of 151. Troponins upon admission: CK-MB
1.4 , CK 63 , and troponin less than 0.10 , d-dimer 1408 , which is
high , PT , PTT , and INR: PT was 17.1 and INR 29.1. ECG normal
sinus rhythm. No ST changes. No Q waves. Chest x-ray: No
evidence of infiltrate. No evidence of congestive heart failure
such as hilar prominence or effusion. Cardiac axilla was
slightly enlarged which is unchanged from her 4/20 films.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular:
Ischemia: The patient was thought to have acute coronary
syndrome and was sent to have a left heart catheterization. At
catheterization , she was found to have a large dyskinetic heart and
severe mitral regurgitation but no angiographically significant
coronary artery disease.
Cardiovascular/pump: Echocardiogram on hospital day 2 showed mild to
moderate left ventricular enlargement with moderate mitral
regurgitation and left atrial enlargement. There was only mild
structural mitral valve disease with MAC and leaflet thickening. Left
ventricular systolic function was moderately to severely impaired.
Management for congestive heart failure was pursued with the intention to
reassess LV size , function and MR after optimizing medical therapy. We
began diuresis at this time with 40 mg of IV Lasix. The patient came in
at 64 kilograms and discharge weight and dry weight is 58.0 kilograms.
The patient was also started on ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker as well as
q.d. p.o. Lasix.
Rhythm: The patient developed atrial fibrillation and atrial
flutter during this hospitalization with rapid ventricular
response. Heart rate was often into the 150s-160s. We were able
to eventually obtain control with Toprol XL 200 mg p.o. q.d. ,
diltiazem p.o. 30 mg t.i.d. , which was then converted to 45 mg
b.i.d. for an outpatient dosing. The patient was also started on
Coumadin while in hospital. She will follow up in Coumadin
Clinic. The day after discharge , she will have labs drawn to
check her INR. She will be on Lovenox 60 mg subcutaneous b.i.d.
until INR becomes therapeutic.
2. Wound care: The patient has open abdominal wound
approximately 2 cm x 2 cm that is followed by Dr. Schoolman , Neville Surgery came by to see Mrs. Lenix in hospital and made
recommendations for wound care. CT scan showed no evidence of entero-
cutaneous fistula. The patient will get follow up wound care at home with
visiting nurses.
