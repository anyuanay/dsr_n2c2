BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
76yoM with CAD s/p CABG 1997 presented with 2-3 weeks of nocturnal
angina with increased nitroglycerin requirement for relief. Given
limitations of imaging modalities due to his severe spinal stenosis ,
MIBI/ETT were not feasible , so the patient presented for elective
catheterization 10/16/06. Upon catherization , two occlusions were noted in
the PLV: a 90% occlusion , as well as a moderate sized plaque.
Revascularization was achieved with the placement of non-drug alluding
stents to these lesions; the original 90% lesion was stented to 0%
occlusion. During the catheterization , Dr. Taran noted a gradient of
40mmHg from the thoracic aorta to the femoral aorta raising the
possibility of this as an etiology for Mr. Mcconnell 's severe lower back pain
and limited ability to ambulate. The catheterization was without
complications. The patient was placed on Plavix x 6 weeks and Aspirin
indefinately following the procedure , and continued on his home regimen
of Captopril , Metoprolol , Isordil , Digoxin , Spironalactone , Insulin ,
Lasix , Zocor and prn Nitroglycerin. Groin sheaths were removed and the
patient was without hematoma or bruit. He had 2 episodes of chest
pressure several hours following the procedure with negative EKG and
stable vitals; the symptoms resolved with oxycodone and did not recur.
On discharge he was ambulating confortably without chest pain or shortness
of breath.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Please take your Aspirin and Plavix. The Aspirin needs to be taken every
day on a long term basis , and the Plavix must be taken for ATLEAST 6
WEEKS from 4/20
DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable
TO DO/PLAN:
Please follow up with your Cardiologist , Dr. Golaszewski
