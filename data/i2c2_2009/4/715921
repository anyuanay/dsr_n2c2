Discharge Date: 4/23/1997
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
PROCEDURE: CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT ON February , 1997.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 49 year-old gentleman
with a ten year history of diabetes
mellitus , peripheral vascular disease , hypertension and increased
cholesterol who was admitted ten days following discharge from the
hospital following treatment for an infected left thigh wound. The
patient ran out morphine three days prior to his admission and
presents with a two day history of chest heaviness and shortness of
breath. The patient originally presented in July of 1997 with a
right foot cellulitis and claudication at 50 yards. This was
treated with debridement and broad spectrum antibiotics and
subsequently treated with amputation of his right toe. On March ,
1997 , the patient underwent a right femoral popliteal bypass. He
was subsequently readmitted in March of 1997 for a left femoral
popliteal bypass and a split thickness skin graft to his fifth toe.
He was admitted again in the end of March through the beginning of
May with a question of a left thigh wound graft infection for
which he was treated with intravenous antibiotics. He was
discharged to home and is now readmitted with chest pain and
heaviness.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for the above with the addition
of hypertension , peripheral vascular
disease , non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and depression.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1 ) Wellbutrin 75 mg p.o. q. day. 2 )
Vasotec 5 mg p.o. q. day. 3 ) Glyburide
5 mg p.o. q. day. 4 ) Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. 5 )
Nafcillin 2 mg intravenously q.4h. 6 ) Morphine.
ALLERGIES: The patient had no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Temperature 98.9 degrees ,
heart rate 92 , blood pressure 122/60.
Pupils were equal , round and reactive to light. His neck
demonstrated a right carotid bruit. There was no lymphadenopathy.
There was no jugular venous distension. Auscultation of the chest
revealed bibasilar rales. Cardiac examination revealed a regular
rate and rhythm without murmurs , gallops or rubs. There was a
normal S1 and S2. Abdominal examination revealed positive bowel
sounds , soft , non-tender , non-distended abdomen. Extremities
demonstrated bilateral groin scars and the left medial thigh wound
which was open for a length of approximately 5 cm with wound
packing. The base of the wound looked well granulated. There was
bilateral ankle edema. Pulses were 2+ dorsalis pedis bilaterally.
LABORATORY: Admission laboratory data revealed that the
electrolytes were normal. His white blood cell count
was 13.9. Liver function tests were within normal limits. CK was
70 and the Troponin I was 0.0.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Medicine Service
where he ruled out for myocardial infarction
with CKs of 39 and 70. His EKGs however demonstrated marked T-wave
inversion in the precordial leads. The chest pressure and
tightness resolved with sublingual nitroglycerin and Lopressor.
His initial presentation was complicated by the fact that it was
thought he was undergoing withdrawal from narcotics which he was
using perioperatively. However , he ultimately underwent a cardiac
catheterization on November , 1997 which demonstrated a 40% mid LAD
lesion and 50% distal LAD lesion , 50% proximal second diagonal
lesion and 99% OM1 lesion with slow flow , along with an 80% OM2
lesion and a 99% RCA lesion. Ejection fraction at that time was
noted to be 40%. Given the patient's presentation , he was booked
for coronary artery bypass grafting which he underwent on February ,
1997. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred
to the Intensive Care Unit postoperatively and had an uneventful
postoperative recovery. He was maintained on Diltiazem for his
radial artery graft. His course was only complicated by
intermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation and flutter. His
thigh wound appeared clean with wet to dry dressing changes and
there was no further evidence of active infection. The patient was
followed by the Stockcord Lo Clark Service ( the drug abuse service ) as well as the
Plastic Surgery Service throughout his hospital stay. Plastic
Surgery felt that his hand was well perfused at the time of
discharge. The patient remained in a normal sinus rhythm after
that brief episode of atrial fibrillation and he was not maintained
on Coumadin at the time of discharge.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1 ) Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o.
q. day. 2 ) Wellbutrin 75 mg p.o. q.
day. 3 ) Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. 4 ) Diltiazem 30 mg p.o.
