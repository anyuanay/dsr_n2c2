Discharge Date: 4/26/1999
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES: 1. Critical ischemia of the right foot. 2.
Stenosis of the left femoral tibial bypass graft.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. Russek is an 85-year-old woman
who is status post a left femoral peroneal bypass graft in
February of 1998 , who presented with right foot pain and
nonhealing ulcers of the right second and third metatarsal joint.
She underwent angiogram on November , 1999 which revealed right
lower extremity patent superficial femoral artery , a 90 percent
distal popliteal stenosis , and three vessel occlusion distal to the
trifurcation , and a 70 percent stenosis of the distal anterior
tibial supplying the dorsalis pedis. The left femoral peroneal had
a long segmented stricture at the level of the knee. Retrograde
filling of the left dorsalis pedis was identified. The patient
presented for surgical management.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. 2.
Atrial fibrillation. 3. History of deep venous thrombosis. 4.
Peripheral vascular disease. 5. Status post right hip fracture
surgery. 6. Status post suprapubic total abdominal hysterectomy.
7. Status post left superficial femoral artery to peroneal bypass
graft. 8. History of diabetic nephropathy.
MEDICATIONS: 1. Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. 2. Humulin 10 in the
morning 6 in the p.m. 3. Digoxin 0.125 mg q.d. 4. MVI one
tablet p.o. q.d. 5. Senokot two tablets p.o. q.d. 6. Vitamin C
500 q.d. 7. Trilisate. 8. Verapamil 60 mg p.o. t.i.d. 9.
Coumadin. 10. Lovenox 30 mg b.i.d.
ALLERGIES: The patient has allergies to penicillin and
Levofloxacin.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was a hard of hearing elderly
woman lying comfortably in bed. Her lungs were clear to
auscultation. Her heart had an irregular rhythm with no murmurs ,
rubs , or gallops. The abdomen was soft , round , non-tender ,
nondistended , bowel sounds were present. Extremities of the
extremities identified superficial ulcers between the right second
and third metatarsals. Vascular examination , on the right side the
right femoral pulse was palpable , popliteal was 2+ dopplerable ,
dorsalis pedis was 1+ dopplerable , and posterior tibial could not
be dopplered. On the left , the femoral pulse was 2+ palpable ,
popliteal was 2+ palpable , the dorsalis pedis had a biphasic
dopplerable signal , and the posterior tibial had a monophasic
dopplerable signal.
HOSPITAL COURSE: On January , 1999 , the patient was brought to
the Operating Room where she underwent a right below the knee
popliteal to anterior tibial bypass with a reversed cephalic vein
graft. She also underwent vein patch angioplasty of the left
femoral tibial artery bypass graft. Her postoperative pulse
examination identified a palpable right dorsalis pedis and a
dopplerable right posterior tibial; left dopplerable dorsalis pedis
and left dopplerable posterior tibial. The patient was ruled out
for myocardial infarction as per the recommendations of the
Cardiology team. Verapamil and digoxin were continued for
appropriate rate control. On postoperative day number one it was
noted that her right arm from which the cephalic vein graft had
been harvested was edematous , and the distal extremity was somewhat
cool. With elevation this resolved. Her digital perfusion was
excellent by clinical examination , and her neurologic function was
intact. The patient was restarted on her Coumadin on postoperative
day number two. Physical Therapy consultation was obtained and
recommended that the patient be discharged to a rehabilitation
hospital to return to her baseline functionable mobility. On
July , 1999 , the patient was discharged to Rehabilitation.
The patient will be discharged to Rehabilitation in stable
condition.
FOLLOW-UP: She will follow-up with Dr. Tamkin . She will also
follow-up with her cardiologist.
