History of Presenting Illness
Mrs. Cantu is a 60 year old female with a history of peripheral arterial disease, aortic stenosis, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease.

For the past year she has had dyspnea on exertion, especially with a flight of stairs. She must stop at the top to rest. She denies chest pain, lightheadedness, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, syncope, or lower extremity edema. A recent echocardiogram in February revealed an ejection fraction of 71%, mild mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 45mmHg, mean of 29mmHg, and a valve area of 0.8 sq cm. There are no wall motion abnormalities of the left ventricle. A stress test in February revealed a reduced exercise capacity with a small area of mild apical ischemia and ejection fraction of 77%. A cardiac catheterization on 3/8 revealed 50% left main stenosis, 40-50% left anterior descending, 30% circumflex and 50% right coronary artery stenosis. Aortic valve area was noted at 0.98 sq cm. Carotid non-invasive studies revealed bilateral 20-49% stenosis.

She was referred to Dr. Gonzalez for an aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass graft surgery. She presents today for preoperative testing and evaluation. She currently notes dyspnea on exertion with two flights of stairs. She denies chest pain, dizziness, or diaphoresis.

    CORONARY ANATOMY FINDINGS: 
     Dominance: Right
     Left Main: The left main coronary artery is of moderate length, 
     intermediate sized vessel. It  bifurcates into the LAD and LCX coronary 
     arteries.  The LMCA has a  50 % stenosis in its ostium.
     LAD: The Proximal LAD has a diffuse 40-50 % stenosis. The Mid LAD has 
     a 50 % stenosis.
     Left Circumflex: The Proximal Circumflex has a 30 % stenosis.
     RCA: The right coronary artery is a dominant vessel. The Proximal RCA 
     has a tubular 50 % stenosis.
