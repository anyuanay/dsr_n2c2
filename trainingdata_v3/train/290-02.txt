History of Present Illness

Asked by Dr. Ehlers to consult on glycemic management for Mr. Ulysses Ehlers who has no history of DM but was noted to be hyperglycemic postop. Mr. Ehlers is POD 1, s/p C4. His family history is positive for diabetes (mother diagnosed in her 80s).  He has required a regular insulin gtt protocol intermittently postop. He is now on a full liquid diet.



Max BG: 197

Current BG: 145

Insulin gtt off at present

 

Mr. Ehlers is a 69 yo M h/o CAD s/p MI 2084 (posterolateral), HTN, hyperlipidemia, a-fib, AAA, PVD, smoking (50 pk yr) who presents for CABG. Initially presented to Bonner General Hospital 9/97 for w/u of exertional chest pain. Cardiac cath was unsuccessful via femoral approach due to presumed aortoiliac occlusion. Subsequent cath 10/18/97 revealed left main stenosis with distal occlusion, RCA proximal occlusion and diffuse LAD stenosis. Pt was transferred to BHCC on 10/19 for further evaluation by the cardiology service. On 10/21 he underwent echo which revealed EF 55% with mild AS. On 10/22, cardiac cath revealed 3 V disease. Cardiac surgery was consulted and recommended CABG after medical optimization. His anginal symptoms remained stable and he was subsequently discharged home on 10/23. He now returns for surgical revascularization. Since his discharge on 10/23, he has not experienced any new or worsening chest pain or SOB. Denies orthopnea, PND.
