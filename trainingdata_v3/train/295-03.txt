HPI: 
Mr. Nathan Vieira is a 73yo M with PMH significant for DM2,  CAD, HTN, hyperlipidemia, hypotonic bladder GERD, psoriasis,  well known in the vascular service for PVD, s/p  LLE angio, thrombectomy 12/78, L fem-pop BPG 4/78, R fem-pop BPG 2/78, RLE angio 1/78 most recently on may LE revascularization procedures,  Popliteal exploration with graft thrombectomy, aortoiliac angiogram, left lower extremity angiogram, angioplasty of posterior tibial artery, angioplasty tibioperoneal trunk and distal anastomosis of bypass graft, stent placement for stenosis of proximal graft. 
Mr. Vieira presented to Dr. Atwood clinic 
today with persistent wound collection in the below knee popliteal incision. He noticed a lump approximately 3 weeks ago, underwent incision and drainage with wick placement and started a course of PO antibiotics. This has continued to drain serosanguinous fluid, apparently the overall induration and erythema with some additional fluid under moderate pressure was released. He has been seen daily by a visiting nurse and she can do the dressing, replacing the wick, and putting a sterile absorbent dressing on top of this. We will see him again in another week.
  He is on coumadin, last dose 3.5 last night. 

Denies fevers chills, SOB, cough.
