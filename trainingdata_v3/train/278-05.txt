Assessment

 73 yo man with type 2 DM and CAD, with worsening glycemic control over the last several months.  Nl bone density despite kyphosis.  



Plan

1. Diabetes

--Glycemia: I estimate his Cr clearance to be 73 cc/min.  Therefore, I recommended and wrote out for him:

a. Increase glipizide to 5 mg po qd

b. Start metformin 500 mg po bid, increase to 1000 mg po bid if no abd sx.  If he can tolerate this, woudl d/c glipizide.

--Pt education re above.

--Ophtho referral



2. Dyslipidemia: controlled on Lipitor



3. Hypertension: controlled, but on the border; may need another agent.



4. Cardiac disease:followed by Dr.Upton; to be referred for ICD eval given CAD and low EF.  On ASA.



5. Decreased vibratory sense: needs B12 on next lab draw.



F/U  December.
