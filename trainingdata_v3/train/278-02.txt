Team 1b Medical Intern Admission Note



Pt:	Jasso, Stephen

MR#: 	 7990698

Date of Admission:  7/05/95

Attending: 	I. Ellsworth



CC:  Vertigo, EKG changes



HPI:  73   yo with h/o of DM, CAD s/p anteroseptal MI (2091) and stent placement presents with 2 days of vertigo, most prominent upon wakening in the a.m.  He reports feeling as if he is spinning while the room is stable; this sensation is worsened by changes in position or head movement.  It diminishes only slightly as the day progresses.  He denies any numbness, weakness, tingling, changes in vision or memory.  He denies any recent URI.  He does report tinnitus which has been present intermittently for years as well as bilateral sensorineural hearing secondary to gunshot exposure.  No NV. The sensation of vertigo is superimposed upon one week of gradually progressive loss of balance, described as not knowing where to put his limbs in relation to space.  He also reports ~7 days of mild diarrhea in a.m only, attributable to eating sorbitol ice cream as well as continuing to take Metamucil for the same 7 day period.  Diarrhea has been fully resolved for 2 days PTA. He does report good PO fluid intake, ~8 bottles of H20 per day.  He monitors his sugars regularly and reports they have been running in the 110-140s. He denies any fevers, chills, sweats or sick contacts.  The patient does have ptosis on the L and reports that this has been present less than one month.  He has had no changes in medications.



Additionally, the patient reports one episode of fleeting chest pain along the midaxillary line on 07/12 which was relieved immediately by NTG.  (Pt attributes the pain to gas as the belching coincident with the NTG also seemed to relieve the pain).  He does also report an increase in SOB after walking up one flight of stairs which has arisen over the past few months.

UA:negative



Guaic: negative



EKG: Old anteroseptal infarct-Q and ST elevations in V2-4



CXR:	The lungs are well aerated. There are no focal areas of

	consolidation or effusion.  The cardiac silhouette is normal in

	size and configuration.  There are no mediastinal abnormalities.

	There are no osseous or soft tissue abnormalities.

	

CT:

	No evidence of acute intracranial pathology.

	Nonspecific periventricular white matter hypodensities most

	consistent with microangiopathic disease in a patient of this age



MRA:  pending

________________________________________________________________________



A/P:  73 yo with h/o HTN, DM, CAD presenting with 2 days of vertigo and one week of loss of balance. Symptoms of vertigo are most consistent with peripheral vertigo.  BPPV most likely as symptoms are worse in a.m and diminish over the day. Given tinnitus Meniers on the diiferential but less likely. Labarynthitis less likely as there is no antecedent infection or associated nausea.  Given multiple risk factors central process such as stroke will image brain.  Vertigo combined with loss of balance, although not elicited on exam, may represent vertebrobasilar insufficiency.  EKG changes concerning for ventricular aneurysm v. anteroseptal reinfarction if viable tissue still remains.  ROMI and Echo in a.m.



Vertigo:

--CT negative for acute process

--MRI pending

--Neurology consulted





CV:

Ischemia

-	ROMI by EKG, markers

-	Transthoracic echo in a.m.

-	continue ASA; titrate up Lopressor for goal HR = 60 as BP tolerates

-	check fasting lipids in AM, continue Lipitor

-	continue lisinopril

-	recent HbA1c 4.4



Pump

-	no signs/symptoms of failure on exam, CXR



Rhythm

-	currently NSR; titrate up BB as above

-	watch for ectopy; keep K = 4, Mg =2



Dispo:

-	code status: FULL
