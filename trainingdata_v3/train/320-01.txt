Ms. Louise Iles is a 70 year old female patient of Dr. Xue here today with first visit with me for several issues.
Met with PCP in Feb for multiple issues, DM changed from Actos to Metformin, referral to Internal Medicine; GERD/H-pylori,  (on meds, GI consult) HTN (changed from nitrates to Lisinopril) cholesterol, HA (lab done to r/o TA and PMR) Hepatitis 

She arrived 20 minutes late for her appointment
Today states:
# 1 HA

HA are much better-less in frequency and duration and intensity, Left area occipital/temporal area
ROS denies any visual problems-but does associate them with stressful times


# 2 DM

Test her BG once a week-reports 134, today 156-ate at 1 PM rice

Stopped Actos-now taking Metformin
