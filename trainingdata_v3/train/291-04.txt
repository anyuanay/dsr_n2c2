BCH SURGERY EW EVALUATION



HPI: Mr. Keating is a 75 year-old male with a complex medical history which includes a history of a stage 4 sacral decubitus ulcer, secondary to being bedridden due to paraplegia (due to injury in 2066).  His ulcer was eroding into his rectum and therefore he underwent sigmoid colostomy 8/96 for diversion.  He is also s/p ileal loop urostomy in the distant past.  Was seen in plastics clinic today, decub progressing well, but poor POs, referred for admission.  Denies N/V, has had normal ostomy output, denies abd pain, though he did have some cramping several days ago.  His main complaint is long-standing back pain.  Of note, he had been readmitted about 2 weeks postop with distention and pain, CT showing partial SBO and a pelvic fluid collection, which was drained, cultures were sterile.  Wife noted some discharge from midline wound several days ago, but this has ceased.

--Check C-dif

--UTI Rx, directed towards the gram negatives he has grown in the past

--Agree with transfusion given CAD hx

--Routine ostomy care, ostomy nurse consult for any ostomy related questions. The ostomy itself appears very healthy, so I doubt the thickening represents hypoperfusion to the distal bowel

--Please contact BCH Surgical Service with any questions
