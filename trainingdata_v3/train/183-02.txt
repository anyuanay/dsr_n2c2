RE:  Roberta Vincent
     MR #380-18-32-2
 
Dear Dr. Xanthos,
 
We had the privilege of seeing your patient, Mrs. Roberta Vincent, in
the Renal Services Clinic on January 18, 2093.  We will
not repeat her history as you know it well. Over the past three
months Mrs. Vincent has complained of increasing fatigue,
occasionally sleeping more than 12 hours per night, forgetfulness
and tingling of the fingers and toes. She has maintained a
relatively good appetite and denies nausea, vomiting or shortness
of breath.  An Iothalamate GFR test obtained on December 14, 2092
revealed a glomerular infiltration rate of approximately 10 ml per
minute, suggesting profound loss of renal function.
 
On physical examination today her weight is 99.5 kilograms or 219
pounds.  Blood pressure is 150/90, pulse is 80 and regular.  The
lungs are clear. There is no peripheral edema. Again, there marked
cushingoid features. Despite overall weight loss, Mrs. Vincent
comments that she has gained facial and abdominal fat as well as
facial hair over the past several months.
 
In summary, Mrs. Vincent appears to be developing early symptoms of
uremia.  Given her advanced azotemia we believe that she should
undergo creation of an arteriovenous fistula so that she may start
dialysis within the next several months. We have arranged to
recheck her chemistries today.  We would also recommend that she
undergo repeat work up for her cushingoid features.  Although renal
failure may alter hormonal balance and may promote occasional
androgenic features in woman, this is beyond ordinary.
 
Thank you once again for allowing us to participate in her care.  
 
Edward Xanthos, M.D.
