Major Problems





Diabetes mellitus

Metformin 1000 mg BID, glyburide 1.25 mg QD.  He is trying to be much more disciplined with his diet and as a result, according to his wife, he is experiencing fairly frequent minor hypoglycemic episodes.  His last hemoglobin A1c six months ago was 6.50.  Recheck today.  I suspect we will be able to discontinue the glyburide.  Urine albumin/creatinine ratio within normal limits six months ago.



Coronary artery disease

Cardiac arrest January 2072 while skiing; multivessel disease on cath; underwent three-vessel bypass (SVGs to the LAD, diagonal, OM).  Most recent ETT January 2076 showed equivocal mild apical reversible defect.  Remains active, has had no chest discomfort of any kind or palpitations.  Continue medical management.



Myasthenia gravis

Remains on Mestinon.  Denies symptoms.



Hyperlipidemia

Remains on pravastatin.  Total cholesterol 151, HDL 70, LDL 72, triglycerides 46 February 2077.  Complains of occasional leg spasms but has no fevers or GI symptoms.  Check CK and transaminases.



Asthma

He continues to be followed by Dr.  Nye; see his notes.  Continues to have occasional episodes of very minor shortness of breath at rest, never with exercise.  Lungs clear.  Doing well.



Gastroesophageal reflux disease

Documented on barium swallow 2069.  Compliant with PPI.  No symptoms.



Anemia

Longstanding issue, hematocrit in mid 30s, MCV mid 90s, iron studies, ferritin, B12, and folate unremarkable.  Check TSH, SPEP.05/25/2077:   TSH and SPEP unremarkable.  Check EPO level, follow CBC.     11/21/2077:   EPO level inappropriately low.  Therefore, suspect anemia is secondary to age-related reduction in renal mass/GFR.



Hypertension

On low-dose ACE inhibitor and beta blocker.  Blood pressure today uncharacteristically elevated, 150/70.  He attributes this to rushing to get to his appointment with me.  Blood pressure earlier this month was 120/55 at his pulmonary visit.  I suspect that he is probably well controlled overall.  For now, no change in management.



Allergies

Penicillin allergy
