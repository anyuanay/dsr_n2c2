RE:  Christine Olivier
     MR #652-33-21-5
 
Dear Dr. Arteaga:
 
Mrs. Olivier returns for routine follow-up.  Currently, she
complains of mild exertional fatigue and rare exertional chest
discomfort.  In addition, she states that she has no energy and
worries that her coronary artery pathology has returned.  She
reports occasionally taking sublingual nitroglycerin for chest
discomfort but this is on an infrequent basis.  
 
She remains on a plethora of medications including NPH insulin 64
units sub q qAM along with 34 units CZI sub q qAM and 68 units NPH
sub q qPM, enteric coated aspirin one tab po q.d., Captopril 25 mg
po t.i.d., Lasix 40 mg po b.i.d., simvastatin 10 mg po q.d.,
amlodipine 5 mg po q.d., Neurontin 900 mg po t.i.d., atenolol 50 mg
po q.d., estrogen 0.05 topically q three days and a nitropatch .2
mg per twenty-four hours which she wears for twelve over 
twenty-four hour period.
 
Physical exam reveals a well-nourished woman in no acute distress. 
Blood pressure right arm sitting 140/80, heart rate 85 and regular,
respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 174 pounds.  The neck is
supple.  JVP flat.  Carotids are 2+ without significant bruits. 
Chest is completely clear.  Cardiac exam shows a normal S1,
physiologically split S2 and a I-II/VI systolic ejection murmur
radiating from the apex to the base, no significant diastolic
murmur or rub.  The abdomen is benign.  Extremities without
appreciable edema.  Peripheral pulses are intact.
 
Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 85.  PR interval
of .14, QRS .08, QT .32, axis -20 degrees.  There are mild diffuse
nonspecific ST-T wave changes as well as evidence for left
ventricular hypertrophy.  Compared to her last electrocardiogram,
her heart rate is slower and her ST-T wave changes are less
prominent.

Impression:  Mrs. Olivier has currently recovered from her 
multi-lesion PTCA and stent placement therapy.  Currently it is not
clear to me that her symptoms are secondary to recurrent ischemia,
however I will have her undergo an exercise tolerance test
(adenosine MIBI) to help to further evaluate this.  In addition, I
will obtain routine blood studies including an glycosylated
hemoglobin.  It is certainly possible that her fatigue and
generalized sense of lack of energy is from a non-cardiac cause. 
Pending review of these lab studies however, I have not altered her
present regimen.  She will contact you or myself should her chest
pain syndrome at all progress in terms of severity or duration.  
 
Thank you very much for allowing me to assist in her care.
 
Sincerely yours,
