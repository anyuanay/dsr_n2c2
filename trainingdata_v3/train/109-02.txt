COLONOSCOPY -  3/31/93 10:00:00 AM

              One sessile polyp with no bleeding was found in the

              transverse colon.  The polyp was three mm in size.

              Polypectomy was performed with a cold snare.  Resection

              was complete.  Retrieval was not done.

              One sessile polyp with no bleeding was found in the

              transverse colon.  The polyp was three mm in size.

              Polypectomy was performed with a cold snare.  Resection

              was complete.  Retrieval was complete.

              Hemorrhoids with no bleeding were found.

              A few diverticula were found in the sigmoid colon and in the

              hepatic flexure.

Impression:   1) Single polyp - three mm.  Complete removal was accomplished.

              3) Hemorrhoids.

              4) Diverticulosis.



     COLON (TRANSVERSE), POLYPECTOMY:

         LOCALIZED AREA OF MILD ACUTE INFLAMMATION WITH CRYPTITIS,

         DYSTROPHIC GOBLET CELLS IN CRYPTS, AND RARE METAPLASTIC PANETH

         CELLS.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:

76 year old female with three days of painless BRBPR, also reports of black stool, history of PUD.  Source of bleeding not clear.  Pattern most typical of LGIB, likely diverticular with significant decline in hematocrit, painless, moderate volume BRBPR.  Agree no real pain for ischemic colitis, though wbc elevated.  No fevers, chills, other GI symptoms or exposure for infectious colitis.  Given black stools, aspirin use, history of PUD, upper bleed also possible, though presentation with red blood and hemodynamic stability atypical for this.  Given insecurity in type of bleed, agree with both EGD and colonoscopy.  



EGD and colonoscopy this morning

Hold aspirin

Continue QD PPI

If hematocrit drops further, would transfuse 1-2 units to hct of 28-30
