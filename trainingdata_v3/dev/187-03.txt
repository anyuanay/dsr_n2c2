Initial Medical Consultation Follow-up



Referred by: Dr. Juan Yun, psychopharmacologist, (PCP is Xavier Hobbs, MC) for comprehensive evaluation of obesity and consideration of treatment options.  Patient is being evaluated concurrently by a nutritionist and a psychologist.



CC/ HPI:  Patient is a 69 year old male, with 

Weight:   227 (  231 )   lbs   Height:    68   Inches   BMI: about  35

and with obesity-related complications as listed below.  Main concerns about weight include: "I am overeating and can't stop".  Pt says he can't stop eating after 3-4 pm, gets enraged, aggressive, anxious, restless, (was given barbiturate and Ativan prn for this, and has improved somewhat ~40%) eats 1/2 gallon of ice cream per day, eats as aggressively as he feels, ongoing for 1.5 yrs.  Afraid he will do something aggressive, and uses entering a "food-coma" to help restrain himself.  Has bipolar, is in "mixed state" now, with characteristics of both depr and mania.  Has neurendoc MD, thinking his pattern related to "peak endocrine secretions".



Had binge drinking episodes till 2 yrs ago.  Drank for 2 days when switching into mania.  Learned to use substitution.  Learned to recognize mania coming on, prodrome, less need for sleep, euphoric speech, spending money.  Wife helped identify this.  Substituted going boating, listening to music, walking, talking to friends.



Wonders if substitution method can work for eating.  A potential method is to use 8 oz water or dietetic candy which have worked to satisfy his hunger.



Learned aggression is PTSD.  Rel to betrayal by mother at age 13.  Trapped, helpless, boxed in.  Medical ailments make him feel the same way.



Has has had talking therapy for ETOH, never for PTSD.



Thinks he may need therapy with wt loss program.
