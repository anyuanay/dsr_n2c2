-        ETT 1/77: CONCLUSION The patient has normal exercise capacity (7 METS).  The ECG is       negative for ischemia.

-        EKG 1/77 as per prior note:  Showed probable evidence of a past inferior MI. RBBB, both new from 7 years ago.  

-        EKG 7/06/77: NSR at 75.  Left axis deviation.  RBBB.  No Sgarbossa criteria.  No changes from prior. 



A/P: 63 yo M p/w NSTEMI.  Hemodynamically stable. 
Currently CP free without EKG changes.



CAD/Ischemia:  Cont. Heparin.  NPO for cath in AM.  Cont. to cycle enzymes to peak.  

-        cont BB/ASA, start Statin

-        Will need integrilin on call to PCI.; NPO for cath in AM

-        TTE in AM

-        Fasting lipids, A1C in AM



CV Pump:  Appears euvolemic.  Cont BB.  Start acei as tolerated.



CV Rhythm: Sinus.  Tele. 


 
OSA: Cont CPAP at night. 



Gerd:  Cont. PPI.  



PPx: Heparin, ASA.  PPI.

FEN: Cardiac. 



                                                                                                                ___________________________
