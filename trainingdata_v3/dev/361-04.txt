CC: 
LLQ pain


HPI: 
Mr. Jay is a 48yo with type II DM c/b diabetic retinopathy, ESRD on HD, bilateral TMA, and HTN who presents with LLQ pain x2 days.
Mr. Jay was seen in the ED the day prior to admission with the same complaint of new onset LLQ pain, which was sharp, non radiating, and most painful with inspiration.  He reports that at this time, he has some mild shortness of breath with the onset of the pain, although this was resolved by the time he was seen in the ED.  He did not complain of any chest pain, palpitations or dipahoresis at that time, although he did have some nausea and vomited once in the ED.  Patient is well known to the ED from prior admissions, and at that time his pain was felt to be 2/2 to throacic radiculopathy/neuropathy 2/2 to his diabetes, however acuity of pain, CT abdomen was performed at that time, which did not reveal any acute patholgy to explain his pain.  He was discharged to home at that time with oral pain medication.  Patient reports that pain did not improve, and was not well controlled with oral pain mediations at home, so he re- presented to the ED.  He does not report any fevers or chills, shortness of breath, cough, back pain, or LE swelling.  Patient is anuric and has been attending dialysis per his usual MWF routine.  


On presentation to the ED, patient was afebrile, BP 180s/90s, HR 70s, satting 100% on RA.  He was given IV morphine for his pain, and IV benedryl for nausea (he has had a cyclic vomiting/nausea syndrome on prior admission which has been effectively treated this way).  Patient reported at that time that he had not had a bowel movement in 3 days, and that he normally has one every other day.  Rectal exam did not reveal any stool in the vault, and CT scan from the day prior did not show excessive stool or evidence of obstruction or fecal impaction.  However, patient was given dulcolax PR.  He was admitted to medicine for further evaluation and pain control.
