CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Tingling and numbness.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 58-year-old woman with a

history of stroke and seizure in 12/2089 and a longstanding

history of diabetes who presents today with a sharp thumbtack

poking sensation in her right hand at 9:30 a.m. while driving. 

It lasted 3-4 seconds and then completely resolved.  Thirty

minutes later, she noticed a similar sensation in her right hand

for a few seconds and then resolved completely, and then she

noticed it in her right foot and the toes.  She wiggles her toes

in her shoe and then that resolved after a few seconds and then

30 minutes after that she had a similar but less severe sensation

in the fingertips of her left hand at about 10:45 that then

resolved completely.  Since then, she has had no sensation like

this.  She has had pins and needles feeling in her hands and feet

in the past, but never a sharp thumbtack feeling like this in the

past.  She had no dysarthria, confusion, weakness, numbness

trauma, dizziness, loss of consciousness, syncope, seizure

activity, changes in her medications, or any new medications. 

She took her Plavix as usual this morning, is now symptom free,

and very well appearing.  She called her doctor's office and the
